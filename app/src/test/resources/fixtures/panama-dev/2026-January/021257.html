Much of this is a question for panama-dev, where we are very aware
of the difficulties of building a user model for vector programming.
I appreciate the similar thread from your here on panama-dev:
<A HREF="https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/panama-dev/2025-September/021141.html">https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/panama-dev/2025-September/021141.html</A>

But the final question is very important for the GC folks, and is indeed
worth a discussion.  Actually we have been discussing it one way or another
for years, at a low level of urgency.  Maybe there are enough concurrent
factors to justify taking the plunge (in 2026?) towards hyper-aligned
Java heap objects, at least large arrays.

Predictable vector performance requires aligned arrays, aligned either
to cache lines or to some hardware vector size.

For Valhalla, if we decide to work with 128-bit value containers,
we would need not only arrays but also class instances that are
aligned to 128 bits.  (Why 128-bit containers?  Well, they are
efficiently atomic on ARM and maybe x86, and many Valhalla types
would use them if they could.  But misaligning them spoils
atomicity.  Valhalla is limited to 64-bit flattening as long as
the existing heap alignment schemes are present.)

Aligning an array is not exactly the same task as aligning an object,
since for arrays you should align the address &amp;a[0], while for an
object o you must align some field &amp;o.f, but you can get away with
aligning &amp;o._header (and put padding after the object header).

In this space, there are lots of ways to pick out a set of
requirements and techniques.

Fundamentally, though, the GC needs to recognize that some array or
(maybe) object is subject to hyper-alignment, and perform special-case
allocation on it.  There&#8217;s lots of bookkeeping around that fundamental,
including sizing logic (might we need more space for inter-object padding?)
and of course the initial contracts.  (I.e., how does the user request
hyper-alignment?)

And there is the delicate question of optimization:  How do we keep
hot loops in the GC from acquiring an extra data-dependent test (for
the &quot;hyper-align bit&quot;).  Can we hide the test under another pre-existing
test?  Can be batch things so that normally aligned objects are segregated
from the hyper-aligned ones, and version our hot loops accordingly?

(&quot;Another pre-existing test&quot; &#8212; I&#8217;m thinking something like an object
header test that already exists, where some rare object header bit
configuration must already be tested for, and is expected to be
rare.  In that case, all hyper-aligned objects, whether arrays or
not, would be put into that rare header state, and on the rarely
taken path in the GC loop that handles the pre-existing rare state,
we&#8217;d also handle the case of hyper-alignment.  Seems likely that
would be an option&#8230;)

On top of all that is portability &#8212; we have to do this work several
times, once for each GC.  Or, if a particular GC configuration cannot
support hyper-alignment, the user model must offer a fallback.

(The fallback might look like, &quot;If you use the vector API you should
really enable Z or G1&quot;.  And also, &quot;You get better flattening for
larger value objects if you run on ARM with Z or G1.&quot;)

I haven&#8217;t even begun to assign header bits here.  The problems are
deeper than that!

I will say one more thing about arrays:  I think it would be very
reasonable to align all arrays larger than a certain threshold size,
fully to the platform cache line size, so that the &amp;a[0] starts at
a cache line boundary.  This goes for primitives, values, whatever.

Call this particular feature &quot;large array hyper alignment&quot;.

It might be a first feature to implement in this space.

I have filed an RFE here: <A HREF="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8374748">https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8374748</A>

Note that many hot GC loops that process arrays are O(a.length).
This means that doing a little extra work for long lengths is
almost by definition a negligible overhead.

Large array hyper alignment would neatly solve Peter&#8217;s problem.

And it would give us a head start towards Valhalla atomics,
as long as we didn&#8217;t paint ourselves into some corner.
The RFE mentions some possible follow-on features.
