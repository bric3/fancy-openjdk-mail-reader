Hi all,
over the past few months we've been experimenting with an implementation of a type class feature along the lines of what Brian presented at last JVMLS [1]. This work is being added to the new "type-classes" branch as part of this PR:

https://github.com/openjdk/valhalla/pull/1886

While this is all still highly experimental, and a long way from being JEP-ready, we thought it might be worth sharing it here, as doing so will enable bleeding edge hackers (such as ourselves!) to carry out further experimentation, especially in the context of providing better support for new Valhalla-based numeric types [2].

More details on how the prototype works and which features it enables will be shared in due time, as we gather more experience with this feature. In other words, this is venue for experimentation, and NOT a proposal for inclusion in the Java platform, and any feedback should be providied while keeping that in mind.

Cheers
Maurizio
